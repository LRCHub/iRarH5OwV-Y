(Words & music: D. Snider)

Yeah right
We got you where we want you and we're never lettin' go
Yeah right, yeah right
We've trapped you in our web now, aren't you old enough to know
Yeah right, yeah right
So stomp your hands and clap your feet, do a dance, hook into the beat

CHORUS:

Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now
Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now
Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now
Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now

We've pulled you into our world and you'll never get away
Yeah right, yeah right
You might as well give in' cause we're big and mean and here to stay
Yeah right, yeah right
So jump and shout, shake and cry, wave your fist, rock until you die

REPEAT CHORUS

Solo - Eddie

Na na na na na na na (na na na na na na na)
Na na na na na na na (na na na na na na na)
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na (na na na)
Na na na (na na na)

So stomp your hands and stomp those feet
Do a dance, hook into the beat

REPEAT CHORUS (twice)
