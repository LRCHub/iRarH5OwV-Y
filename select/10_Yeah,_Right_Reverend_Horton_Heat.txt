You're telling me things
That you're gonna do,
Just like you told me all the time
That you'd always be true.

Telling me you and him
Yes you're just freinds.
Where do lies stop
And the truth begins?

Yeah right!
Yeah right!

Wear my cross up around you're throat,
Struttin all around in the leapord coat,
Noddin' my head like I know you could
But you never did nothing that you said you would.

Yeah right!
Yeah right!

It sure sounds like you've got it all worked out,
It sure sounds like you've got it all worked out to me!

Gonna be a model for the neighbors and then,
Move to California and live with a freind,
Go to school and work somewhere in Santa Fe
Go on expedition down in paraguay.

Yeah right!
Yeah right!

It sure sounds like you've got it all worked out,
It sure sounds like you've got it all worked out to me!

Spoken:
Yeah right, You're gonna move to California
And live with your good freinds,
And then your gonna go skiing
With your good freinds from school,
The state school!

Yeah right
